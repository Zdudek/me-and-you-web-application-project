        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>MeAndYou.us is the brain child of Professor Michael Jonas and his Spring 2016 COMP 730 class.  The idea behind it was to create an application which would allow people to search for each other anonymously and make a connection if both parties had explicitly searched for each other.  The idea blossomed from being able to find and reconnect with a previous relationship partner from the past who may be also looking to rekindle their relationship.  From there it evolved into allowing registered users to not just search for an old relationship but to secretly alert users to those users who may have a crush on them, allow users to reconnect with distant family members or even revive old friendships.  
		<br>
		<br>
		In order for this all to work, both registered users would have to select the type of connection they would like to make with the other person, enter any details they know about the person like their name, e-mail address, phone number, or any previous addresses they may have had and search.  Our application will do the rest of the work!  If it turns out the person you are searching for is also searching for you, our database will match and alert the users that a connection has been made.  This approach allows users to reconnect with each other in a very anonymous and indirect manner which may be the best way in the case of previous failed relationships or even family issues which may have divided the two users in the first place. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Here at MeAndYou.us, we hope you have a great time using our application and are very successful in reconnecting with those people that at one point were very important in your lives!
